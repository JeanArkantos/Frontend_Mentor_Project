# Project Frontend Mentor - Completed Parts 3/20

This is a project related to the Frontend Mentor website, where I will create 20 projects using only HTML and CSS. Other projects outside Frontend Mentor can be added.

- The first 10 projects will be created with the help of guides and videos on Youtube, I will always try to learn and not just copy.

- The last 10 projects will be done completely without the help of guides and videos, they will only be done with what I learned and researching the documentation.

Each folder is an individual project with its README. There you will have the explanations about what I learned and other information.

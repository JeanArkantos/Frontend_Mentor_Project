### What I learned

This page was created entirely without the help of step-by-step videos, I only had to resort to StackOverflow, Google and Youtube for some problems that arose.

Things I learned the most during this project.

- I found a way to not get lost with Flex, Grid, Margin and Padding. Basically I create a border inside of each div, this made it a lot easier to understand what I was doing wrong in each div.
- I started using multipurpose classes directly in HTML tags, something like Tailwinds.
- filter in CSS.

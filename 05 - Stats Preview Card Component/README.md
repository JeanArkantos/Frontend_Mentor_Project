# Stats Preview Card Component - Frontend Mentor

### What was the objective?

Create a preview card with two elements, one side containing text and the other with an image, which both adapt according to the user's resolution.

### What I learned

I had some difficulty with the part of the grid that contained the image, I still need to study more about width, height and margin. Apart from that part, I managed to execute everything else with relative ease.

Things I learned the most during this project.

- overflow (for the border-radius of the img)
- ::after (I didn't know this, I'll study more about it.)
- positining, width, height and margin (I practiced more, but I need to study more.)

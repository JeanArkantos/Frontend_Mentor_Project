# OneBitCode Academy

This was a project done during the Fullstack JavaScript Programmer course. The goal was to create a gym landing page using both FlexBox and Grid.

This project was created completely from scratch, I just based it on guidance on how the site should look like.

### What I learned

- How to add an anchor link to jump to a specific part of a page.
- overflow-x

It took me approximately 5 hours to finish, I found it a very difficult task. I had some difficulties thinking about how and when to use each element (flex or grid). But in the end, I was able to execute and I feel really good about having created something from scratch without following the guidance of the course instructor.

I believe that as this project progresses and more and more landing pages are finished, I will have a much better grasp of various base CSS elements.

# Ordem Summary - Frontend Mentor

Fronteend Mentor entry-level project. This landing was done entirely without the help of videos, but when I finished the project I consulted a video to compare my code and draw some conclusions.

### What I learned

At first I had some difficulty aligning the container exactly in the center of the screen, I ended up choosing to transform the body into flex, I saw later in a video that a different solution could be applied.

> .container {
> position: absolute;
> left: 50%;
> top: 50%;
> transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
> max-width: 450px;
> background-color: white;
> }

I didn't know this way of aligning and I found it very interesting, it was because of this challenge that I decided to study a little better about positining in CSS.

# Testimonials grid section

This project was made to improve my knowledge with CSS Grid. [Link to the online repository on Vercel](https://frontend-mentor-project-tau.vercel.app)

It was made with the help of a video from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xMQfnTU6oo), despite that, I made some solutions different from the one presented in the video, like a @media for 1050px resolution.

### What I learned

Through the Traversy Media video, I learned about the BEM CSS methodology, a way to write HTML and CSS in a more organized way. I ended up researching and learning about this concept.

CSS elements that were not acquainted that I learned in this project.

- border-radius
- box-shadow
- opacity
- background-(image/repeat/position)
- Grid I already knew, but I learned a little more in practice.

I made a new solution for the responsiveness below 1050px, in the challenge in question it didn't ask for a solution for that, but I thought the grid didn't look cool between 1050px to 768px, so the Grid goes from 3 columns to 2 (tablet) then 1 on mobile version.

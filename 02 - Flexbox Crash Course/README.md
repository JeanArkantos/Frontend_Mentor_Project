This project was made to learn a little more about Flexbox. [Link to the online repository on Vercel](https://frontend-mentor-project-tau.vercel.app)

It was made with the help of a video from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YW65K6LcIA), despite that, I made some solutions different from the one presented in the video, like a @media for 400px resolution.

This is not a Frontend Mentor Project.

### What I learned

About the Flexbox content, this project served more to train knowledge, since most of the Flex properties I already knew.

Discover the [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) website and how to use it.

Most of the CSS elements used in this project I already knew, so it wasn't a new thing, but I managed to learn a little better how Selectors work in CSS, and I managed to know better some new elements like box-shadow.

I made a new solution for the responsiveness below 400px, In the version made by the Traversy Media video, it didn't look very nice at that resolution (in fact, he didn't even put a solution for this res), so I wanted to do it differently and put my own solution for responsiveness.
